The `reliverse cmod` command allows you to easily apply powerful codemods (code modifications) to your project. Codemods automate complex or repetitive refactoring tasks, saving significant time and effort while ensuring consistency across your codebase.

## Features

- üß© **Interactive Codemod Selection**  
  Easily select and apply codemods from an intuitive prompt.

- ‚ö° **Instant Refactoring**  
  Quickly apply multiple code transformations in one go.

- üöÄ **Safe and Reversible**  
  Codemods are applied intelligently, allowing you to review and revert changes as needed.

- üéØ **Customized Refactoring**  
  Supports configurable codemods tailored to your project's specific needs.

## Getting Started

Install or update **@reliverse/cli**:

```sh
bun i -g @reliverse/cli
reliverse update
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Run `reliverse cmod` to launch the interactive codemod selection:

```sh
reliverse cmod
```

You'll be prompted with a checklist of available codemods to apply:

- ‚úÖ Select the codemods you want.

### Direct Mode

Directly apply codemods by specifying their names:
